# Information - custom_cards
This organization (shared space) was a result of a short discussion over on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/c5DvZ4e).

A similar organization (shared space) was also made for [custom_components](https://github.com/custom-components).

This shared space is **not** supposed to be a replacement of any kind to the official sites/documentation for Home Assistant.

 - [Home Assistant GitHub](https://github.com/home-assistant)
 - [Home Assistant website](https://www.home-assistant.io/)
 - [Home Assistant developer documentation](https://developers.home-assistant.io/)

This shared space is a place where all users that develop [custom_cards](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/en/lovelace_custom_card.html) are invited to share their codes for discoverability.
This space has some benefits.
 - Users that are looking for custom_card will have fewer places to look.
 - There is less chance that multiple developers are working on the same thing.
 - Users can :star: the cards that they love and most popular will get a higher chance to get adopted into official lovelace

#### Installing the custom_cards
For the latest instruction on how to install custom_cards please view the [official documents](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/frontend/custom-ui/lovelace-custom-card)

#### Rules
Like all other places there are need for some rules.
Your repository should have a name like this `name-card` i.e. `weather-card`.

In the repository there should be at least 2 files.
the card (.js) file, and a README.md file.
The README file should contain instructions on how to "use" it, and a configuration example.
